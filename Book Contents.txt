How to Start a Topic :
give me a comprehensive guide of <Subject_Name>, detailed divided into chapters, like i am writing any book, from beginner level to expert level, list all the things in an index , in a proper md format. Make it soo large, that I have to continue generating response. and later use those index to write a book, include topics like <List_importtant topics you don't want to miss, also say it to show implementation if needed> . Do not miss anything, any sub topics.

How to continue it : 

this is the content of chapter <chapter_number_here> : "<chapter_content_here>"

use this content to generate a book like comprehensive guide of python, detailed divided into topics and topics, like i am writing any book, from beginner level to expert level, list all the things which is nessesary, in a proper md format, you could also add emojis to make it fun to read. Make it soo large, that I have to continue generating response. Show the implementation in a short way. Make the guide in such a way, that it is detailed, but don't decribe a lot, make it short to read, and cramp up information, so that with a very little things, I could learn a lot.
