**Chapter 1: Overview of Google Cloud Platform**

### Types of Cloud Services
Public cloud providers like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft offer various services to deploy computing, storage, networking, and other infrastructures to run a range of business services and applications. Cloud users can be new companies starting in the cloud or enterprises supplementing their existing data centers.

- **New Companies**: Startups can choose services that fit their application and architectural needs without considering existing infrastructure.
- **Established Enterprises**: Companies with existing investments, like a Microsoft Active Directory solution, may need to integrate their systems with cloud services, adding complexity and synchronization efforts.
- **Network Security**: Enterprises need to secure networks between on-premise and cloud resources. High-volume traffic may justify dedicated networking, while lower traffic might use virtual private networks (VPNs), requiring additional design and management.

### Categories of Cloud Services
Public cloud providers offer services in four broad categories:
1. **Compute Resources**
2. **Storage**
3. **Networking**
4. **Specialized Services (e.g., Machine Learning Services)**

#### Compute Resources
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Basic computing units; users can configure, administer, and manage VMs as needed. GCP offers preconfigured VMs and custom configurations, along with services like load balancers and autoscalers for high availability and cost control.
- **Managed Kubernetes Clusters**: For users focusing on applications rather than server maintenance. Containers isolate processes, and managed clusters handle health monitoring, networking, and security tasks.
- **Serverless Computing**: No need for VMs or Kubernetes clusters setup. GCP offers:
  - **App Engine**: For long-running applications and containers.
  - **Cloud Functions**: For code running in response to events (e.g., file uploads, message queue additions).

#### Storage
- **Object Storage**: Manages storage as objects or blobs in buckets. GCP's Cloud Storage is accessible via URL, offers high availability, and is serverless.
- **File Storage**: Hierarchical file system storage, decoupled from VMs. GCP's Cloud Filestore provides network shared file systems.
- **Block Storage**: Uses fixed-size data structures (blocks) and is available on VMs in GCP. Supports persistent (independent of VMs) and ephemeral disks (data lost when VM shuts down).
- **Caches**: In-memory data stores for fast data access, reducing latency compared to SSDs or HDDs. Caches are volatile and require a strategy for synchronization with the system of truth.

#### Networking
- **IP Management**: VMs in the cloud require IP addresses, both internal (within GCP network) and external (Internet accessible).
- **Firewall Rules**: Control access to subnetworks and VMs, ensuring security and proper data flow.
- **Peering**: Linking distinct networks for shared data and network access between on-premise data centers and VPCs.

#### Specialized Services
- **Serverless and API-Driven**: Provide specific functions (e.g., text translation, image analysis) without server setup.
- **GCP Specialized Services**:
  - **AutoML**: Machine learning service.
  - **Cloud Natural Language**: Text analysis.
  - **Cloud Vision**: Image analysis.
  - **Cloud Inference API**: Time-series data correlation.

### Cloud Computing vs. Data Center Computing
Key differences between cloud and on-premise data centers:
- **Rent Instead of Own**: Public clouds offer short-term rental of resources, allowing businesses to handle peak loads without purchasing excess capacity.
- **Pay-as-You-Go**: Charges based on usage, enabling cost control.
- **Elastic Resource Allocation**: Quickly add or remove resources in the cloud, unlike the slower, hardware-dependent process in data centers.
- **Specialized Services**: Public clouds provide advanced computing capabilities (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing) accessible to non-experts.
