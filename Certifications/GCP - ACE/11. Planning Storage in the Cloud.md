# Chapter 11: Types of Storage Systems

## Time to Access Data
- L1 Cache: 0.5 ns
- Services: Hours

## Latency Units
- ns: 10^-9 s
- Î¼s: 10^-6 s
- ms: 10^-3 s

## Persistence
- Caches: Low latency, volatile
- Disk Drives: Higher durability, redundancy

## GCP Storage Services
- Managed Redis cache
- Persistent disk storage (VMs)
- Object storage
- Archival storage

## Cache
- In-memory data store, low latency
- Limited by memory, volatile
- GCP: Memorystore (managed Redis)

## Persistent Storage
- Durable block storage for VMs
- Types: SSD, HDD
- Features: Multi-reader, snapshots, encryption, zonal/regional options

## Object Storage
- Large volumes, no file system operations
- GCP: Cloud Storage
- Classes: Multiregional, Regional, Nearline, Coldline

### Multiregional and Regional Storage
- Multiregional: High availability, higher cost
- Regional: Redundant across zones, lower cost

### Nearline and Coldline Storage
- Nearline: Less frequent access, lower cost, retrieval charge
- Coldline: Annual access, lowest cost, retrieval charge

## Pricing Summary
- Regional: $0.20/GB/month
- Multiregional: $0.26/GB/month
- Nearline: $0.10/GB/month, $0.01/GB access
- Coldline: $0.07/GB/month, $0.05/GB access

## Versioning and Lifecycle Management
- Versioning: Retain object history
- Lifecycle Policies: Automate class changes or deletions

### Lifecycle Conditions
- Age, number of versions, creation date, storage class

### Lifecycle Actions
- Delete or change storage class

## Creating Buckets
- Navigate: Storage > Create Bucket
- Provide: bucket name, storage class, labels, encryption keys (Google/customer-managed)
- Set retention policy

## Lifecycle Policy
- Navigate: Storage > Browse
- Modify lifecycle: select bucket > Lifecycle column (None/Enabled) > Add Rule
- Rule conditions: Age, Creation Date, Storage Class, Newer Versions, Live State
- Rule actions: Set storage class to nearline or coldline

## Storage Types
- **Caches**: Fastest, volatile, e.g., Memorystore
- **Persistent Storage**: SSDs (faster, costly) and HDDs (large, slower)
- **Object Storage**: Long-term, e.g., Cloud Storage (regional, multiregional)

## Data Models
- **Object Storage**: Cloud Storage (large data, no fine-grained access)
- **Relational Databases**: Cloud SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL), Cloud Spanner (global consistency, transactions)
- **Analytics**: BigQuery (petabytes, not for transactions)
- **NoSQL**: Datastore (document), Cloud Firestore (real-time updates), Bigtable (wide-column, petabyte-scale)

## Configuring Cloud SQL
- Navigate: Cloud SQL > Create Instance
- Choose: MySQL (1st/2nd Gen) or PostgreSQL
- Configure: name, password, region, zone, MySQL version, connectivity, machine type, backups, replicas, flags, maintenance window, labels

## Configuring Cloud Spanner
- Navigate: Cloud Spanner > Create Instance
- Provide: instance name, ID, nodes, regional/multiregional

## Configuring BigQuery
- Navigate: BigQuery
- Create Dataset: name, region

## Configuring Datastore
- Navigate: Datastore > Create Entity
- Provide: namespace, kind, key, properties (name, type, value)

## Configuring Cloud Firestore
- Navigate: Firestore > Choose storage system (Datastore/Firestore native mode) > Select location

## Configuring Bigtable
- Navigate: Bigtable > Create Instance
- Provide: instance name, ID, mode (production/development), disk type (SSD/HDD)
- Configure clusters: ID, region, zone, nodes

## Multiple Databases Use Case
- **Relational DB (e.g., Cloud SQL)**: Patient records (structured, transaction support)
- **Data Warehouse (e.g., BigQuery)**: Analyzing patterns, ETL process from relational DB

## Choosing a Storage Solution

### Factors to Consider:
- **Read and Write Patterns:**
  - Frequent read/write: Cloud SQL (structured data), Cloud Spanner (global database), Bigtable (high volume), Cloud Storage (file download)
- **Consistency:**
  - Strong consistency: Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner
  - Configurable strong consistency: Datastore (longer IO operations)
  - Eventual consistency: NoSQL (faster read/write)
- **Transaction Support:**
  - Use databases with transaction support: Cloud SQL, Spanner, Datastore
- **Cost:**
  - Depends on data stored, retrieved, scanned, and VM costs
- **Latency:**
  - Low-latency: Bigtable
  - Longer latency but globally consistent: Spanner

### Summary:
- **Storage Systems:**
  - Memorystore (cache service)
  - Persistent disks (network-accessible disks for VMs)
  - Cloud Storage (object storage)
- **Data Models:**
  - Object, relational, NoSQL (document, wide-column)
  - Cloud Storage: object model
  - Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner: relational databases
  - BigQuery: relational model for analytics
  - Datastore, Firebase: document databases
  - Bigtable: wide-column table
- **Considerations:**
  - Read/write patterns, consistency, transaction support, cost, latency

## Exam Essentials:

- **Major Storage System Types:**
  - Caches, persistent disks, object storage
  - **Caches:** Improve performance, limited by memory
  - **Persistent disks:** Network devices, can be attached to multiple VMs
  - **Object storage:** Files for shared access, long-term storage
- **Data Models:**
  - **Relational databases:** Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner (transaction processing)
  - **BigQuery:** Relational model for data warehouses, analytics
  - **Object model:** Files as atomic units
  - **NoSQL:** Document (Datastore, Firebase), wide-column (Bigtable)
- **Cloud Storage Classes:**
  - Regional, multiregional, nearline, coldline
  - **Multiregional:** Replicates across regions
  - **Regional:** Replicates across zones
  - **Nearline:** Infrequent access (< once/month)
  - **Coldline:** Archival storage (< once/year), retrieval charges
- **Multiple Data Stores:**
  - Example: Cache (reduce latency), Cloud SQL (queries), object storage (long-term), BigQuery (analytics)
- **Lifecycle Configurations:**
  - Used to delete files/change storage class
  - Regional/multiregional can change to nearline/coldline
  - Nearline can change to coldline
  - Regional can't change to multiregional, and vice versa
- **Characteristics to Determine Best Option:**
  - Read/write patterns, consistency, transaction support, cost, latency
