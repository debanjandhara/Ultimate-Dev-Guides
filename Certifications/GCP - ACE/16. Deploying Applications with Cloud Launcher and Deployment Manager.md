# Chapter 16: Deploying a Solution Using Cloud Launcher

## Key Points

- **Cloud Launcher (Marketplace):**
  - Central repository of deployable apps and datasets.
  - Two-step process: Browse & Deploy.

- **Browsing Cloud Launcher:**
  - Navigate to Marketplace in Cloud Console.
  - Filter solutions by category (e.g., OS, datasets, developer tools).
  - Solutions available: LAMP stack, WordPress, SAP HANA, etc.
  - Filter OS by license type: Free, Paid, BYOL.

- **Deploying Solutions:**
  - Select solution, view overview, pricing, and package details.
  - Fill deployment form: name, zone, machine type, admin email.
  - Configure persistent disk, network, and firewall rules.
  - Launch solution from overview page.

- **Deployment Manager:**
  - Create custom solution configs in YAML.
  - **YAML Syntax:** 
    - `resources:`
      - `name`
      - `type`
      - `properties`
  - **Example:**
    ```yaml
    resources:
      - type: compute.v1.instance
        name: ace-exam-deployment-vm
        properties:
          machineType: <MACHINE_TYPE_URL>
          disks:
            - deviceName: boot
              type: PERSISTENT
              boot: true
              autoDelete: true
    ```

- **Launching Deployment Manager Template:**
  - Command: 
    ```bash
    gcloud deployment-manager deployments create <deployment-name> --config <config-file>
    ```
  - Check status:
    ```bash
    gcloud deployment-manager deployments describe <deployment-name>
    ```

## Exam Essentials

- Browse solutions using Cloud Launcher.
- Configure and deploy solutions in Cloud Console.
- Use Deployment Manager for custom configurations.
- Understand YAML syntax for resource definitions.
- Use `gcloud` commands for deploying and managing templates.
