# Storage Components of Google Cloud Platform

## Storage Resources
- **Cloud Storage**: Object storage system.
  - Objects organized into buckets (analogous to directories).
  - Not a file system; service for storing/retrieving files or objects.
  - Accessible from VM or any network device with appropriate privileges.
  - Uniquely addressable by URL.

### Cloud Storage Classes
- **Regional Storage**: Single region, low latency access.
- **Multiregional Storage**: Replicas in multiple regions, high availability.
- **Nearline Storage**: Infrequent access, cost-effective.
- **Coldline Storage**: Archival storage, low cost, accessed < once/year.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automated object management based on policies (e.g., move to nearline after 60 days).

## Persistent Disk
- Attached to VMs in Compute Engine/Kubernetes Engine.
- **SSD**: Low latency, higher cost.
- **HDD**: Large storage, lower cost.
- Supports multiple readers, resizable without VM restart.
- Max size: 64TB.

## Cloud Storage for Firebase
- Object storage for mobile app developers.
- Secure transmission, robust recovery for unreliable networks.
- Accessible via CLI and SDKs.

## Cloud Filestore
- Network-attached shared file system for Compute Engine/Kubernetes Engine.
- High IOPS, variable storage capacity.
- Uses NFS protocol.

## Databases
- **Cloud SQL**: Managed relational database service (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - First-gen MySQL: MySQL 5.5/5.6, up to 16GB RAM, 500GB storage.
  - Second-gen MySQL: MySQL 5.6/5.7, up to 416GB RAM, 10TB storage.
  - PostgreSQL: Up to 64 CPUs, 416GB RAM, 10TB storage.
  - Supports replication, automatic failover.

- **Cloud Bigtable**: Petabyte-scale NoSQL wide-column data model.
  - Low latency, millions of operations/sec.
  - Integrates with Cloud Storage, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Dataproc.
  - Supports Hbase API.

- **Cloud Spanner**: Globally distributed relational database.
  - Combines relational benefits with NoSQL scalability.
  - 99.999% availability SLA, encryption at rest/in transit.

- **Cloud Datastore**: NoSQL document database.
  - Flexible schemas, automatic scaling, transactions, SQL-like queries.
  - Suited for high scalability applications (e.g., product catalogs, user profiles).

- **Cloud Memorystore**: In-memory cache service (managed Redis).
  - Submillisecond access to data, managed service (high availability, patching).

- **Cloud Firestore**: NoSQL database for web/mobile apps.
  - Real-time data sync, offline support, backend data management.
  - Includes Datastore mode for compatibility.
  - Native Mode: Real-time synchronization, offline support.
  - Datastore Mode: Compatible with Datastore applications.

## Key Points
- **Cloud Storage**: Object storage, various classes (regional, multiregional, nearline, coldline), lifecycle management.
- **Persistent Disk**: Block storage for VMs, SSD/HDD options, resizable.
- **Cloud Storage for Firebase**: Mobile-focused, secure, robust recovery.
- **Cloud Filestore**: NFS-based shared file system, high IOPS.
- **Cloud SQL**: Managed relational DBs, supports MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- **Cloud Bigtable**: NoSQL, wide-column, petabyte-scale, low latency.
- **Cloud Spanner**: Globally distributed relational DB, high availability, encryption.
- **Cloud Datastore**: NoSQL document DB, flexible schema, automatic scaling.
- **Cloud Memorystore**: Managed Redis cache, submillisecond access.
- **Cloud Firestore**: NoSQL DB for scalable web/mobile apps, real-time sync.

## Additional Notes
- Use **Cloud Storage** for storing large objects and files.
- **Persistent Disk** is ideal for VM-attached block storage.
- **Cloud Filestore** for network-attached file systems.
- **Cloud SQL** and **Cloud Spanner** for relational database needs.
- **Cloud Bigtable** for large-scale NoSQL applications.
- **Cloud Datastore** for flexible, scalable NoSQL storage.
- **Cloud Memorystore** for in-memory caching.
- **Cloud Firestore** for real-time, offline-supported NoSQL databases.
