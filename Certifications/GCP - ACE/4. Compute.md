# Cloud Platform - Compute Engine and App Engine

## Compute Engine
- **VMs**: Virtual Machines (instances) run on Compute Engine.
- **Images**: 
  - Public images: Linux (CentOS, Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu) and Windows.
  - Custom images: Create from boot disk or other images.
- **Snapshots**: Save VM state for reuse.
- **Zones and Regions**:
  - Zones: Data center-like resources within regions.
  - Regions: Geographical locations (e.g., asia-east1, us-east4).
- **Privileges**:
  - Roles: Compute Engine Admin, Network Admin, Security Admin, Viewer.
  - Permissions can be project-wide or resource-specific.
- **Preemptible VMs**:
  - Short-lived, cost-effective for fault-tolerant workloads.
  - Terminated within 24 hours, may not be available, no SLA.
- **Custom Machine Types**:
  - Adjust vCPUs and memory.
  - Cost based on configuration.
- **Use Cases**: Maximum control, specific image, software installation, fine-grained permissions.

## App Engine
- **Types**:
  - **Standard Environment**:
    - Preconfigured runtimes, limited customization.
    - Languages: Python 2.7, PHP 5.5, Go 1.9 (Gen 1); Java 8, Python 3.7, PHP 7.2, Node.js (Gen 2).
  - **Flexible Environment**:
    - Customizable with Docker containers.
    - Supports multiple languages and tools.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Standard Environment**: Best for supported languages, less control.
  - **Flexible Environment**: Good for containerized services, customizable runtime.
- **Scaling**:
  - Standard: Autoscaling, scales to zero.
  - Flexible: Autoscaling but always at least one instance running.

## Kubernetes Engine

- **Compute Engine**: Manage VMs (instances) individually or in groups (instance groups).
- **Kubernetes**: Open-source tool by Google for managing clusters of VMs and containers (K8s).
  - **Functions**:
    - Create and manage VM clusters for containers.
    - Deploy and manage containerized applications.
    - Autoscaling, monitoring, logging, and node pools.
- **Kubernetes Cluster**:
  - **Master Node**: Manages the cluster (API server, resource controllers, schedulers).
  - **Worker Nodes**: Run the container workloads.
  - **Pods**: Groups of containers sharing resources.
- **Resource Reservations**:
  - **Memory**: 25% of first 4GB, 20% of next 4GB, 10% of next 8GB, 6% of next 112GB, 2% above 128GB.
  - **CPU**: 6% of first core, 1% of next core (up to two), 0.5% of next two cores (up to four), 0.25% above four.
- **High Availability**:
  - **Eviction Policies**: Shut down pods when resources are low.
  - **Deployments**: Three states (Progressing, Completed, Failed).
- **Use Cases**: Large-scale apps requiring high availability and reliability.

## Cloud Functions

- **Serverless**: Runs code in response to events without managing infrastructure.
  - **Languages**: Node.js 6, Node.js 8, Python 3.7.
  - **Execution**:
    - Secure, isolated environment.
    - Scales automatically.
    - Stateless by default.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **IoT**: Process data from sensors.
  - **Mobile Apps**: Process data uploads.
  - **Asynchronous Workflows**: Steps in workflows independent of timing.

## Summary

- **Compute Engine**: Provision and manage VMs.
- **App Engine**: PaaS with standard and flexible environments (custom containers).
- **Kubernetes Engine**: Manages clusters, provides load balancing, autoscaling, and monitoring.
- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless, event-driven, independent executions.

## Exam Essentials

- **VM Instances**: Run from images, organized in projects.
- **Geographic Regions**: VMs run in zones (e.g., asia-east1, europe-west2).
- **Preemptible VMs**: For workloads that can be interrupted.
- **App Engine Environments**: Standard (language-specific) vs. Flexible (custom containers).
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration, load balancing, autoscaling.
- **Cloud Functions**: Event-driven, runs code in response to triggers.
