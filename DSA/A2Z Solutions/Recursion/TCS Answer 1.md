To solve this problem optimally, we can model it as a **combinatorial optimization problem** involving subsets of strings with constraints. The challenge involves **maximizing worth**, subject to budget and contradictory string constraints. Below is a step-by-step plan for solving the problem.

---

### **1. Problem Analysis**
- **Key Decisions**:  
  You need to decide which strings to include in the final subset such that:  
  1. The total cost of selected strings â‰¤ budget.  
  2. No two contradictory strings are selected.  
  3. The total worth of selected strings is maximized.

- **Constraints**:  
  This is similar to a **0/1 Knapsack Problem**, with the added complexity of "conflict pairs."

---

### **2. Approach**
The problem can be tackled using **Bitmask Dynamic Programming**. This technique allows us to efficiently represent the selection of strings and handle constraints systematically.

#### **Why Bitmask DP?**
1. Each string has two states: included or excluded.  
   A bitmask can represent these $N$ states compactly.  
2. We can encode contradictory constraints efficiently by ensuring certain bitmask states are invalid.  
3. Using DP, we compute the maximum worth for valid subsets without re-evaluating already-checked states.

---

### **3. Algorithm**

#### **Step 1: Preprocessing**
1. **Compute Worths**: For each string, calculate its worth as the sum of character place values.  
   Example: For `"kite"`, worth = $11 + 9 + 20 + 5 = 45$.  
   
2. **Create Conflict Graph**:  
   Use a dictionary to store contradictory pairs as undirected relationships.  
   Example: If `A` contradicts `B`, store both $G[A] = [B]$ and $G[B] = [A]$.

---

#### **Step 2: Dynamic Programming**

1. **Define the DP State**:  
   - Let `dp[mask][budget]` represent the maximum worth achievable using the subset of strings indicated by `mask`, within the given `budget`.  
   - `mask` is a bitmask of length $N$, where the $i$-th bit is `1` if the $i$-th string is included and `0` otherwise.

2. **Transition Function**:  
   - For each string $i$, you can either:  
     - Include it in the subset (if no conflicts and budget allows), or  
     - Exclude it.  
   - Recurrence:  
     $
     dp[mask | (1 << i)][remaining\_budget - \text{cost}[i]] = \max(dp[mask][remaining\_budget] + \text{worth}[i], dp[mask][remaining\_budget])
     $

3. **Handle Contradictions**:  
   - For each `mask`, ensure that no two strings in `mask` are contradictory using the conflict graph.

4. **Base Case**:  
   - $dp[0][\text{budget}] = 0$, i.e., no strings selected, worth is zero.

5. **Iterate Over Masks**:  
   - Use nested loops over $mask$ and `budget` to evaluate all possible subsets.

---

#### **Step 3: Optimization and Pruning**
- **Early Exit**:  
  If including a string exceeds the budget or violates a conflict, skip that transition.  
- **Prune Infeasible Masks**:  
  Use the conflict graph to check if any mask has contradictory pairs.  

---

### **4. Final Answer**
- Iterate over all valid `mask` values and pick the one with the maximum worth under the budget constraint.

---

### **5. Complexity Analysis**
1. **State Space**: $O(2^N \times B)$, where $N$ is the number of strings and $B$ is the budget.  
2. **Transitions**: For each `mask`, evaluate $N$ transitions.  
   - Overall: $O(2^N \times B \times N)$.  

This is feasible for $N = 50$ (up to $2^{50}$) and $B = 500$ due to the pruning and bitmask optimizations.

---

### **6. Common LeetCode Questions**
This problem is similar to:  
1. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**:  
   - LeetCode #416 (Partition Equal Subset Sum).  
   - LeetCode #494 (Target Sum).  

2. **Subset Problems with Constraints**:  
   - LeetCode #1986 (Minimum Number of Work Sessions).  
   - LeetCode #1125 (Smallest Sufficient Team).  

These questions involve selecting subsets under constraints.

Here are Python and C++ solutions using **Bitmask Dynamic Programming** for the problem. Both solutions follow the algorithm described earlier.

### **Python Solution**

```python
def calculate_worth(string):
    """Calculate the worth of a string based on character values."""
    return sum(ord(char) - ord('a') + 1 for char in string)

def max_worth_with_budget(N, M, strings, costs, contradictions, budget):
    # Step 1: Precompute worths
    worths = [calculate_worth(s) for s in strings]
    
    # Step 2: Create conflict graph as a dictionary
    conflict_graph = {i: set() for i in range(N)}
    string_index = {strings[i]: i for i in range(N)}
    for a, b in contradictions:
        conflict_graph[string_index[a]].add(string_index[b])
        conflict_graph[string_index[b]].add(string_index[a])

    # Step 3: Initialize DP
    dp = [[-1] * (budget + 1) for _ in range(1 << N)]
    dp[0][budget] = 0  # Base case: no strings selected, full budget available

    # Step 4: Bitmask DP
    for mask in range(1 << N):
        for remaining_budget in range(budget + 1):
            if dp[mask][remaining_budget] == -1:
                continue  # Skip invalid states
            
            # Iterate over all possible strings to include
            for i in range(N):
                if mask & (1 << i):  # If string i is already included, skip
                    continue
                
                # Check for contradictions
                valid = True
                for conflicting in conflict_graph[i]:
                    if mask & (1 << conflicting):
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    continue
                
                # Check budget feasibility
                if remaining_budget >= costs[i]:
                    new_mask = mask | (1 << i)
                    new_budget = remaining_budget - costs[i]
                    dp[new_mask][new_budget] = max(dp[new_mask][new_budget],
                                                   dp[mask][remaining_budget] + worths[i])

    # Step 5: Find maximum worth
    max_worth = 0
    for mask in range(1 << N):
        max_worth = max(max_worth, max(dp[mask]))
    return max_worth

# Example usage
N = 5
M = 5
strings = ["crow", "sky", "park", "thursday", "flying"]
costs = [6, 3, 4, 9, 13]
contradictions = [("flying", "sky"), ("sky", "thursday"), ("crow", "sky"), ("park", "sky"), ("park", "flying")]
budget = 20

print(max_worth_with_budget(N, M, strings, costs, contradictions, budget))

### **Explanation of the Code**
1. **Precompute Worths**: Use the helper function `calculate_worth` or `calculateWorth` to determine the worth of each string.
2. **Conflict Graph**: Store contradictory pairs in a graph for efficient conflict validation during DP transitions.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use `dp[mask][budget]` to represent the maximum worth for a given subset of strings (`mask`) and remaining budget.
4. **Final Result**: Find the maximum value across all DP states.

Both solutions are optimized for the constraints $N \leq 50$ and $budget \leq 500$.
