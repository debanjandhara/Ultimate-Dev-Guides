To solve this problem optimally, we can analyze it as a grid-based shortest path problem with additional constraints for strength and shark interactions. The approach involves using **Dijkstra's algorithm** or a similar pathfinding algorithm with slight modifications to handle both **time minimization** and **strength management**. Here's the step-by-step algorithm:

### **Step-by-Step Approach**

#### **1. Problem Mapping**
- Represent the grid as a graph where each cell is a node.
- Edges between nodes are defined by possible moves (up, down, left, right).
- Each edge has two weights:
  - **Time cost**: From the `time` matrix.
  - **Strength cost**: 1 unit for movement + shark strength if encountered.

#### **2. Key Observations**
- Multiple states can exist for the same cell, as Hari can arrive with different strength levels.
- Using standard shortest path techniques (like BFS) without considering strength would fail.
- The algorithm must track the **minimum time** required to reach each cell with at least 0 strength.

#### **3. Algorithm Choice**
We use a **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)** for an optimized pathfinding algorithm, as in Dijkstra's. The queue stores states with:
- **(Time, Strength, Position)**.

#### **4. Algorithm Steps**
1. **Initialization**:
   - Parse the input to get matrices for `shark_strength` and `time`.
   - Identify the source cell (`S`) and destination cell (`D`).
   - Initialize a 3D array `visited[N][M][K+1]` to track if a state `(row, col, strength)` has been processed.
   - Push the initial state `(0, K, S)` (0 time, K strength, starting position) into the priority queue.

2. **Processing States**:
   - Pop the state `(current_time, current_strength, current_position)` from the priority queue.
   - If this is the destination (`D`) and `current_strength >= 0`, return `(current_time, current_strength)`.
   - Skip processing if:
     - The current position and strength have already been processed.
     - Strength is negative.
   - Mark the current state as visited.

3. **Exploring Neighbors**:
   - For each neighbor of the current cell:
     - Compute the **time cost** and **strength cost** to move to that neighbor:
       - `new_time = current_time + time[neighbor]`
       - `new_strength = current_strength - (1 + shark_strength[neighbor])`
     - If `new_strength >= 0` and the state `(neighbor, new_strength)` is unvisited:
       - Push `(new_time, new_strength, neighbor)` into the priority queue.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If the priority queue is exhausted and no feasible path is found, return `"Not Possible"`.

### **Algorithm Complexity**
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - Each cell can have up to $K$ states based on strength.
   - The priority queue processes all states, leading to $O(N \times M \times K \log(N \times M \times K))$ complexity.
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The `visited` array and priority queue consume $O(N \times M \times K)$ space.

### **Pseudocode**
```python
def minimum_time_and_strength(N, M, shark_strength, time_cost, K, start, end):
    import heapq

    # Priority queue for (time, strength, position)
    pq = [(0, K, start)]  # Initial state: (time=0, strength=K, start)
    visited = [[[False for _ in range(K+1)] for _ in range(M)] for _ in range(N)]

    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up

    while pq:
        current_time, current_strength, (x, y) = heapq.heappop(pq)

        # If destination reached with valid strength
        if (x, y) == end and current_strength >= 0:
            return current_time, current_strength

        # If already visited with this strength, skip
        if visited[x][y][current_strength]:
            continue

        visited[x][y][current_strength] = True

        # Explore neighbors
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < M:  # Valid neighbor
                new_time = current_time + time_cost[nx][ny]
                new_strength = current_strength - (1 + shark_strength[nx][ny])

                # Push valid new state into priority queue
                if new_strength >= 0 and not visited[nx][ny][new_strength]:
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_time, new_strength, (nx, ny)))

    # If no feasible path is found
    return "Not Possible"
```
