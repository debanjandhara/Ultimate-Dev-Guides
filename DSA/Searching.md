the issue : If you are setting mid = (left + right)/2, you have to be very careful.
Unless you are using a language that does not overflow such as Python,
left + right could overflow. 
One way to fix this is to use left+ (right−left)/2 instead.

If you fall into this subtle overflow bug, you are not alone.Even Jon Bentley's
own implementation of binary search had this overflow bug and remained 
undetected for over twenty years.


The issue mentioned in your text relates to how the midpoint (`mid`) is calculated in a binary search algorithm, particularly in languages where integer overflow can occur, like C++ or Java. Here's a breakdown:

### **Overflow in Midpoint Calculation:**
- **Standard Calculation:** `mid = (left + right) / 2`
  - Here, `left` is the starting index and `right` is the ending index of the array.
  - If `left` and `right` are large integers, adding them together might exceed the maximum value an integer can hold, causing an overflow.
  - In languages like Python, integers can grow as large as needed, so you don't have this issue. But in languages with fixed integer sizes (e.g., `int` in C++), this can cause a problem.
  
- **Safe Calculation:** `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`
  - This formula avoids overflow because `right - left` is always within the bounds of the array's size, making it a smaller number and thus avoiding potential overflow.
  - By adding this smaller number to `left`, you get a safe midpoint calculation.

### **Binary Search Algorithm: Searching in Sorted Array**
Binary search works on a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialize:** Set `left` to 0 and `right` to the length of the array minus one.
2. **Calculate Midpoint:** Use the safe formula to calculate `mid`.
3. **Comparison:** 
   - If the target value is equal to `arr[mid]`, you've found the target and return the index.
   - If the target is less than `arr[mid]`, continue searching in the left half by setting `right = mid - 1`.
   - If the target is greater than `arr[mid]`, continue searching in the right half by setting `left = mid + 1`.
4. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `left` exceeds `right`, meaning the target is not in the array.

### **Binary Search Implementation:**
Here’s a simple implementation of binary search that works for both even and odd lengths:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        # Safe calculation of mid to avoid overflow
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
    
    return -1  # Target not found
```

### **Explanation:**
- **Even Length Array:** If the array has an even number of elements, the midpoint will be the lower middle element.
  - E.g., for `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `mid` would start at index 1 (element 2).
  
- **Odd Length Array:** If the array has an odd number of elements, the midpoint will be the middle element.
  - E.g., for `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `mid` would start at index 2 (element 3).

This method works consistently regardless of whether the array length is even or odd.
