### Space Complexity vs. Auxiliary Space Complexity

**Space Complexity:**
- **Definition:** Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space that an algorithm requires relative to the input size. This includes:
  - **Input space:** The space required to store the input itself.
  - **Auxiliary space:** The extra or temporary space that the algorithm uses during execution (e.g., for variables, function call stacks, recursion, etc.).

**Auxiliary Space Complexity:**
- **Definition:** Auxiliary space complexity specifically refers to the additional space or temporary space used by the algorithm, excluding the space taken by the inputs. Itâ€™s a subset of the space complexity.
  - **Focus:** Only accounts for the extra memory the algorithm needs (e.g., space for variables, temporary arrays, and recursion stacks).

### Example to Clarify

Consider an example where you want to reverse an array.

1. **In-Place Reversal:**
   - **Algorithm:** Reverse the array in place by swapping elements.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n) (n is the size of the array because you need to store the array).
   - **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1) (only a few extra variables for swapping).

2. **Reversal Using an Extra Array:**
   - **Algorithm:** Create a new array to store the reversed elements.
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n) (n for the input array + n for the extra array).
   - **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(n) (extra array used for storing reversed elements).

### Key Takeaway:
- **Space complexity** considers the total memory used, including the input size.
- **Auxiliary space complexity** only considers the extra memory used by the algorithm itself, excluding the input.
