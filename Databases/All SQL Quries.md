# Understanding SQL 🗃️

This guide is a structured overview of SQL essentials. SQL (Structured Query Language) enables powerful data manipulation within relational databases. Let’s dive into the concepts and operations that form the backbone of SQL!

## Introduction ✨
SQL is a standard language used to interact with relational databases, helping analyze, manage, and transform data.

## Database 🗄️
Databases store and organize data. Within them, data is arranged in **tables** — with rows representing individual records and columns representing fields.

### Tables and Structure 📋
A **table** consists of rows and columns:
- **Columns** define the type of data (fields).
- **Rows** represent records.

### Constraints 🎛️
SQL tables use **constraints** to maintain data integrity:
- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row.
- **Foreign Key**: Links a row in one table to another.
- **Unique**: Ensures values are not duplicated.
- **Check**: Sets conditions that data must meet.
- **Default**: Specifies a default value for a column.

## Data Manipulation Language (DML) 🔄
DML operations let you work with data.

### SELECT 🚀
Retrieves data from one or more tables.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table;
```

### INSERT ➕
Adds new records to a table.
```sql
INSERT INTO table (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
```

### UPDATE ✏️
Modifies existing data in a table.
```sql
UPDATE table SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;
```

### DELETE 🗑️
Removes records from a table.
```sql
DELETE FROM table WHERE condition;
```

## Joins: Combining Data from Tables 🔗

### INNER JOIN 🔍
Retrieves matching records in both tables.
```sql
SELECT columns FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id;
```

### LEFT JOIN ⬅️
Retrieves all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.

### RIGHT JOIN ➡️
Retrieves all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.

### FULL OUTER JOIN 🔄
Combines LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN, showing all matched and unmatched records.

### CROSS JOIN ➕
Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.

## Operators 🔄

### Logical Operators 🔍
- **AND**: Combines multiple conditions, returning results that match all.
- **OR**: Returns results that match any condition.
- **NOT**: Excludes records that match the condition.

### SQL Operators: Useful for Filtering 🎛️
Operators modify how data is filtered, manipulated, and calculated.

### Functions 🔠
SQL provides functions to manipulate and calculate data.

#### Numeric Functions 🔢
Perform calculations, e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`, `ROUND`.

#### String Functions ✂️
Manipulate text, e.g., `CONCAT`, `SUBSTRING`.

#### Date/Time Functions ⏳
Operate on date and time, e.g., `GETDATE`, `DATEADD`.

#### NULL Functions ❌
Handle `NULL` values in queries.

## Data Query Language (DQL) 🔍

### FROM 📍
Specifies the table(s) data is pulled from.

### WHERE 🎯
Filters records based on a condition.

### GROUP BY 📊
Groups rows with the same values in specified columns.

### HAVING 🎛️
Filters groups based on a condition (used with GROUP BY).

### ORDER BY ⬆️⬇️
Sorts results in ascending (**ASC**) or descending (**DESC**) order.

### LIMIT ⛔
Limits the number of returned records.

## Data Definition Language (DDL) 🏗️
DDL defines and modifies the structure of database objects.

### CREATE 🛠️
Creates a new table or database.
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column1 datatype,
   column2 datatype,
   ...
);
```

### DROP 🗑️
Deletes tables, databases, or views.

### ALTER 🖋️
Modifies existing database objects.

### RENAME 🔄
Renames tables or columns.

## Data Control Language (DCL) 🔐
DCL controls access to data within the database.

### GRANT 📝
Gives users specific permissions.

### REVOKE 🚫
Removes user permissions.

## Transaction Control Language (TCL) ⚙️
TCL manages database transactions, ensuring integrity.

### START (BEGIN) TRANSACTION 🚦
Begins a new transaction.

### COMMIT 💾
Saves all changes made during the transaction.

### ROLLBACK ⏪
Reverts changes if an error occurs.

## Data Types 📊
Data types specify the kind of data stored.

- **Numeric**: `INT`, `DECIMAL`
- **String**: `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`
- **Date/Time**: `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`
- **Boolean**: `BIT`
- **JSON**: Stores JSON format data

## Views and Indexes 🏞️
Views and indexes help optimize and structure your database.

### View 👁️
A virtual table based on a query’s result.

### Index 📑
Speeds up data retrieval but adds overhead during data changes.
