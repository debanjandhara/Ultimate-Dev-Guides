## üêç PYTHON

### ‚úÖ What is Python?

* **Python** is a **high-level, interpreted, general-purpose** programming language.
* Created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**.
* Emphasizes **readability**, with a clean, easy-to-learn syntax that uses **indentation** rather than braces.

### ‚úÖ Why Python?

* **Beginner-friendly** and widely used in **education**, **data science**, **AI/ML**, **web development**, **automation**, and **scripting**.
* Rich ecosystem with libraries like:

  * `pandas`, `numpy` (data)
  * `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow` (machine learning)
  * `Flask`, `FastAPI`, `Django` (web)
* Used by major companies like **Google**, **Netflix**, **Instagram**, etc.

### ‚úÖ Key Features:

* **Dynamically typed**
* **Interpreted**, not compiled
* **Object-Oriented + Functional**
* Large standard library ("batteries included")
* Cross-platform

### ‚úÖ Downsides:

* **Slower** than C/C++/Java due to interpreter
* **Not ideal** for low-level memory management
* **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** limits true multithreading

## ‚òï JAVA

### ‚úÖ What is Java?

* **Java** is a **high-level, class-based, object-oriented**, **compiled + interpreted** programming language.
* Developed by **James Gosling at Sun Microsystems**, released in **1995**.
* Famous for "**Write Once, Run Anywhere**" (WORA), thanks to the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

### ‚úÖ Why Java?

* Used for **enterprise applications**, **Android development**, **backend systems**, and **financial services**.
* Strongly typed and follows strict **OOP principles**.
* Popular frameworks: `Spring`, `Hibernate`, `Maven`

### ‚úÖ Key Features:

* Compiled to **bytecode** ‚Üí Runs on **JVM**
* **Automatic Garbage Collection**
* **Multithreaded** and **secure**
* Large ecosystem and community

### ‚úÖ Downsides:

* **Verbosity** ‚Äì more boilerplate code than Python
* **Startup performance** (though better with JIT)
* Slower than C/C++

## üíª C++

### ‚úÖ What is C++?

* **C++** is a **general-purpose, compiled, high-performance** programming language.
* Developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup**, as an extension of **C** (released in **1985**).
* Adds **Object-Oriented Programming**, **templates**, and **standard libraries** to C.

### ‚úÖ Why C++?

* Used in **system programming**, **game engines**, **real-time systems**, **compilers**, and **performance-critical apps**.
* Control over **memory management**, **hardware**, and **optimization**.
* Supports **RAII**, **pointers**, **manual memory allocation**, etc.

### ‚úÖ Key Features:

* **Compiled** directly to machine code
* **Supports multiple paradigms**: OOP, procedural, generic
* **STL (Standard Template Library)**: prebuilt templates and algorithms
* More **control over system resources** than Java or Python

### ‚úÖ Downsides:

* **Complex syntax** and **steeper learning curve**
* Manual memory management ‚Üí risk of **segmentation faults**, **memory leaks**
* **Long compile times**

## üß† C

### ‚úÖ What is C?

* **C** is a **procedural, low-level, compiled** language.
* Developed by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Labs** in the early **1970s**.
* Known as the **"mother of all programming languages"**, influencing C++, Java, Python, Go, Rust, etc.

### ‚úÖ Why C?

* **Super close to hardware** ‚Äì used in **OS development**, **embedded systems**, **device drivers**, **compilers**.
* Used to build Unix, Linux kernels, and the original implementation of Python and Git.

### ‚úÖ Key Features:

* **Manual memory management** (`malloc`, `free`)
* Lightweight, fast, and **efficient**
* Direct use of **pointers**
* **Procedural**, not object-oriented

### ‚úÖ Downsides:

* No classes, objects, or modern abstraction
* Prone to **buffer overflows**, **undefined behavior**
* **No built-in garbage collection**
* Less readable and harder for beginners
