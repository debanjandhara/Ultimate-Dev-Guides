    *   Arrays (declaration, initialization).
*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) - VERY IMPORTANT:**
    *   **Encapsulation:** The concept of bundling data (variables) and methods.
    *   **Inheritance:** `extends` keyword, "is-a" relationship, types of inheritance.
    *   **Polymorphism:** Method Overloading and Method Overriding.
    *   **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and Interfaces.
*   **Keywords:** `static`, `final`, `super`, `this`.

### **Part B: Hands-On Coding (Java) - 70 Minutes | 50 Marks**

This section tests your problem-solving and implementation skills. You have a generous amount of time.

*   **Problem 1:** Easy-Medium Difficulty (15 Marks)
*   **Problem 2:** Medium Difficulty (35 Marks)

#### **Essential Concepts & Problem Areas to Practice:**

1.  **IDE and Boilerplate Code:**
    *   Be comfortable taking input using the `Scanner` class (`Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);`).
    *   Practice reading different data types: `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, `next()`, `nextLine()`.
    *   Remember to print output exactly as required using `System.out.println()` or `System.out.print()`.

2.  **Arrays (Highest Priority):**
    *   Iterating, searching for an element, finding min/max.
    *   Sorting (you can use `Arrays.sort()`).
    *   Finding the Nth largest/smallest element.
    *   Calculating sum/average of elements.
    *   Problems involving frequency of elements.

3.  **Strings (High Priority):**
    *   Reversing a string, checking for palindromes.
    *   Counting vowels, consonants, digits, and special characters.
    *   Anagram checks.
    *   Character case conversion (UPPER/lower).
    *   Extracting substrings.

4.  **Logical & Mathematical Problems:**
    *   Prime numbers, Armstrong numbers, Perfect numbers.
    *   Factorials, Fibonacci series.
    *   Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM).

5.  **Object-Oriented Implementation:**
    *   Be prepared for problems where you need to create a class (e.g., `Player`, `Book`, `Course`) with attributes and methods as described in the problem statement.
    *   You might need to create an array of objects and perform operations on it (e.g., "find the player with the highest score").

6.  **Basic Collections (To Simplify Solutions):**
    *   **ArrayList:** Use it when you need a dynamic array.
    *   **HashMap:** Extremely useful for frequency counting problems.
    *   **HashSet:** Use it to find unique elements or check for existence quickly.

### **Final Strategy & Pro-Tips**

1.  **Go Through TCS Xplore:** The official Xplore portal is your **#1 resource**. The material there is specifically designed for this exam. Prioritize it above all else.
2.  **Time Management:** In the MCQ section, don't get stuck. If you're unsure, make an educated guess and move on. In the coding section, read both problems first. If one seems much easier, solve it first to secure marks.
3.  **Practice on a Platform:** Use HackerRank, LeetCode (easy), or GeeksforGeeks to practice coding problems from the topics listed above. This builds speed and confidence.
4.  **No Negative Marking:** This is a gift. **Attempt every single question.**
5.  **Read the Coding Problem Carefully:** Pay close attention to input/output formats, constraints, and edge cases (e.g., empty arrays, negative numbers).

Follow this index diligently, and you will be very well-prepared for the IPA. Good luck
