# 📄 Key Documents & Artifacts

Creating well-organized and comprehensive documentation is the backbone of building a scalable technical solution. Here are the basic documents you need:

1. **Solution Requirements Document (SRD) / Business Requirements Document (BRD)**  
   - **Purpose:** Captures the platform’s vision, functional & non-functional requirements, user personas, and business goals.  
   - **Content:**  
     - Platform overview  
     - Stakeholder interviews summary  
     - Use cases (e.g., student registration, institutional admin workflows)  
     - Acceptance criteria  
   - **Placement:** Store in the `/docs` folder of your repository (e.g., `/docs/requirements/SRD.md`).

2. **Technical Design Document (TDD) / Architecture Document**  
   - **Purpose:** Outlines the technical solution, integration of no-code tools (Webflow, Airtable, Memberstack, Zapier), system architecture, and integration points.  
   - **Content:**  
     - High-level architecture diagrams  
     - Technology stack rationale  
     - Integration points and data flow  
     - Scalability and security considerations  
   - **Placement:** In the `/docs/architecture` directory (e.g., `/docs/architecture/TDD.md`).

3. **User Flow Maps & Process Diagrams**  
   - **Purpose:** Visualize and document the flows for different user roles (students, institutions, educators, etc.) so that developers and designers have a clear picture of the interactions.  
   - **Content:**  
     - Flowcharts for landing page → signup/login → dashboard → detailed module flows  
     - Sequence diagrams for interactions with integrations (e.g., triggering a Zapier automation)  
   - **Placement:** Save your diagrams as images or PDFs in `/docs/diagrams/user-flows/`.

4. **Feature Roadmap & Growth Plan Document**  
   - **Purpose:** Aligns the immediate MVP features with longer-term goals (e.g., a 5 Horizon growth plan).  
   - **Content:**  
     - Breakdown of MVP features with timelines  
     - Milestones for future enhancements (e.g., campus engagement features)  
   - **Placement:** Maintain this in `/docs/roadmap/feature-roadmap.md`.

5. **Wireframe/Prototype Briefing Materials**  
   - **Purpose:** Provides handoff details for the UI/UX team, ensuring consistency between the design prototypes and technical requirements.  
   - **Content:**  
     - Annotated wireframes, interactive prototypes, UI guidelines  
     - Branding & style guidelines  
   - **Placement:** Typically maintained in a design tool (e.g., Figma) and referenced here via exports in `/docs/design/` or linked accordingly.

6. **Repository README and Contribution Guidelines**  
   - **Purpose:** Acts as the entry point for the project, explaining the project structure, how to use the repository, and guidelines for contributions.  
   - **Content:**  
     - Project overview  
     - Setup instructions (even for integrating no-code components)  
     - Repo structure outline  
   - **Placement:** At the root of the repository (`README.md` and a dedicated `/CONTRIBUTING.md`).

7. **Integration & Automation Guidelines**  
   - **Purpose:** Details how the no-code integrations (Webflow, Airtable, Memberstack, Zapier) interact, including custom scripts or configurations if any.  
   - **Content:**  
     - API connection details  
     - Workflow triggers and actions  
     - Troubleshooting tips  
   - **Placement:** In the `/docs/integration/` folder.

# 📁 Repository Structure

An organized repo helps maintain clarity among developers and stakeholders. Here’s an example structure:

```
edtech-mvp/
├── README.md                   # Project overview, setup, and repo structure
├── CONTRIBUTING.md             # Guidelines for contributing
├── docs/
│   ├── requirements/
│   │   └── SRD.md              # Business & functional requirements
│   ├── architecture/
│   │   └── TDD.md              # Technical design and architecture details
│   ├── diagrams/
│   │   └── user-flows/         # Contains user flow images/PDFs
│   ├── roadmap/
│   │   └── feature-roadmap.md  # Feature breakdown and timeline
│   ├── integration/
│   │   └── automation-guidelines.md  # Automation and integration details
│   └── design/
│       └── wireframes.pdf      # Exported wireframes or design assets
├── webflow/                    # Assets exported from Webflow (if applicable)
└── scripts/                    # Any utility scripts (e.g., automation, data migration)
```

This structure centralizes all key artifacts, making the project easy to understand and update.

# 🪜 Step-by-Step Process Flow for the MVP

Below is a step-by-step flow that ties the documents and the repository setup together as you progress from concept to developer-ready deliverables.

### Step 1: Requirement Gathering & Vision Alignment
- **Activities:**  
  - Conduct discovery sessions with the founding team.  
  - Define overall platform goals, user roles (Student, Institution, etc.), and desired outcomes.
- **Deliverable:**  
  - **SRD Document** (outlined in `/docs/requirements/SRD.md`) that captures detailed requirements.

### Step 2: Define the Technical Foundation
- **Activities:**  
  - Choose a no-code tech stack (Webflow, Airtable, Memberstack, Zapier).  
  - Develop integration guidelines.
- **Deliverable:**  
  - **TDD / Architecture Document** (in `/docs/architecture/TDD.md`).

### Step 3: Design User Flows & Process Diagrams
- **Activities:**  
  - Create detailed user flow maps for each role using flowchart and sequence diagrams.

# 💡 Best Practices & Tips

- **Centralized Documentation:**  
  Maintain a single source of truth using a structured repository. Use version control (e.g., Git) for the documentation too.  
- **Clear Naming Conventions:**  
  Use consistent names for documents and file paths, making it easy for anyone to locate information quickly.  
- **Visual Clarity:**  
  Use diagrams liberally—visuals often reduce the need for lengthy explanations and prevent misunderstandings.  
- **Stakeholder Reviews:**  
  Regularly review documents with both non-technical stakeholders and technical teams to ensure mutual understanding.  
- **Iterative Updates:**  
  As you receive feedback or add new features, update your documentation in parallel. This alignment ensures that the technical foundation remains reliable and up-to-date.
