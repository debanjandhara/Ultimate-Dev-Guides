What is Normalisation: 
Normalization is the process to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data integrity in the table. Normalization also helps to organize the data in the database. It is a multi-step process that sets the data into tabular form and removes the duplicated data from the relational tables.

Normalization organizes the columns and tables of a database to ensure that database integrity constraints properly execute their dependencies. It is a systematic technique of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy (repetition) and undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion anomalies.

1st Normal Form (1NF):

A table is referred to as being in its First Normal Form if atomicity of the table is 1.
Here, atomicity states that a single cell cannot hold multiple values. It must hold only a single-valued attribute.
The First normal form disallows the multi-valued attribute, composite attribute, and their combinations.

2NF:
1. Relation must be in 1NF.
2. There should not be any partial dependency.
1. All non-prime attributes must be fully dependent on PK.
2. Non prime attribute can not depend on the part of the PK.

3NF:
1. Relation must be in 2NF.
2. No transitivity dependency exists.
1. Non-prime attribute should not depend on a non-prime attribute.

BCNF (Boyce-Codd normal form):
1. Relation must be in 3NF.
2. FD: A -> B, A must be a super key.
3. We must not derive prime attribute from any prime or non-prime attribute

Advantages of Normalisation
1. Normalisation helps to minimise data redundancy.
2. Greater overall database organisation.
3. Data consistency is maintained in DB
