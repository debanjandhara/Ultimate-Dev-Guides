# Access Modifiers in C++

Access Modifiers or Access Specifiers in a class are used to assign the
accessibility to the class members, i.e., they set some restrictions
on the class members so that they canâ€™t be directly accessed by outside functions.

There are 3 types of access modifiers available in C++:

- **Public**
- **Private**
- **Protected**

For Java, an additional modifier exists:

- **Default (Java)**

## Syntax:

```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    // Members declared here are accessible from anywhere
    int publicVar;
    void publicMethod();

private:
    // Members declared here are accessible only within the class
    // Only the member functions or friend functions/friend class are allowed to access the private data members of the class.
    int privateVar;
    void privateMethod();

protected:
    // Members declared here are accessible within the class and by derived classes
    int protectedVar;
    void protectedMethod();
};
```
