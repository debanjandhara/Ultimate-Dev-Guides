Static variables:
Variables declared as static in a function are created & initialised once for the lifetime of the program.(in function)

Static variables in a class are created & initialised once . They are shared by all the objects of the class.(in class)

Static objects:

Static objects refer to objects that have static lifetime and storage. When a member variable or a method is marked as static in a class, it behaves differently compared to non-static members. 

Static Member Functions:

Static member functions are functions that can be called on the class itself, without creating an instance of the class.

Key Points to Remember:

1.Static variables:

Belong to the class, not to individual objects.
Only one copy is shared across all objects.
Must be initialized outside the class.

2.Static Member Functions:

Can be called using the class name without creating objects.
Can access only static variables or other static functions.

3.Static Objects:

Have a lifetime that persists until the program ends.
Are created only once, regardless of how many times the function they are declared in is called.
