The operating system (OS) is structured in layers, each serving a specific purpose to manage hardware and software resources. Here’s a breakdown of the OS layers:

### **Layers of an Operating System**
1. **Hardware Layer** 🖥️  
   - Physical components like CPU, memory, disk, and I/O devices.  
   - The OS interacts with hardware through device drivers.

2. **Kernel Layer** 🧠  
   - The core part of the OS, managing resources and system calls.  
   - Handles process scheduling, memory management, file systems, and device drivers.

3. **Abstraction Layer** 🔄  
   - Provides a uniform interface for interacting with hardware.  
   - Includes APIs and system calls that allow applications to communicate with the OS.

4. **Shell (User Interface) Layer** 🖥️⌨️  
   - Provides an interface for users to interact with the OS.  
   - Can be a Command-Line Interface (CLI) (e.g., Bash, PowerShell) or Graphical User Interface (GUI) (e.g., Windows Explorer, GNOME).

5. **Application Layer** 📦  
   - Where user programs and applications run.  
   - Examples: Browsers, text editors, media players, etc.

This layering ensures **modularity**, **security**, and **efficient resource management** in an OS. Let me know if you want a visual representation! 🚀
