# RabbitMQ Concepts and Code Examples

## RabbitMQ Concepts

### **1. Channel**

- **Definition**: A channel is a virtual connection within a RabbitMQ connection. All RabbitMQ operations occur over a channel.
- **Purpose**: Channels are used to perform tasks like declaring exchanges, queues, and publishing/consuming messages.
- **Types**:
  - **Blocking Channel**: A channel where operations are blocking, meaning the program waits for an operation to complete before proceeding. Suitable for simple use cases.
  - **Non-Blocking (Normal) Channel**: Channels used in asynchronous or threaded environments, allowing other operations to proceed while waiting for responses.

### **2. Exchange**

- **Definition**: An exchange routes messages to one or more queues based on routing rules.
- **Types**:
  - **Direct Exchange**: Routes messages with a specific routing key.
  - **Topic Exchange**: Routes messages to queues based on wildcard matching of routing keys.
  - **Fanout Exchange**: Routes messages to all bound queues.
  - **Headers Exchange**: Routes messages based on message header attributes.

### **3. Queue**

- **Definition**: A queue stores messages until they are consumed by a consumer.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Durable**: A durable queue survives server restarts and is maintained until deleted.
  - **Exclusive**: An exclusive queue is used only by the connection that declares it and is deleted when the connection closes.
  - **Auto-Delete**: An auto-delete queue is deleted when the last consumer unsubscribes.

### **4. Routing Key**

- **Definition**: A routing key is used to route messages to specific queues. Itâ€™s a string that acts as a filter or identifier.

## Code Examples

### **Publishing Messages**

To publish messages, you need to declare the exchange and queue, bind them, and then publish the message.

```python
import pika

def publish_mq(exchange: str, routing_key: str, message: str, host: str = 'localhost', user: str = 'user', password: str = 'password'):
    credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(user, password)
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=host, credentials=credentials))
    channel = connection.channel()

    # Declare exchange and queue
    channel.exchange_declare(exchange=exchange, exchange_type='topic', durable=True)
    channel.queue_declare(queue=routing_key, durable=True)
    channel.queue_bind(exchange=exchange, queue=routing_key, routing_key=routing_key)

    # Publish message
    channel.basic_publish(exchange=exchange, routing_key=routing_key, body=message)
    print(f"Published message: {message} to {routing_key}")

    connection.close()
```

### **Consuming Messages**

To consume messages, declare the queue and set up a callback function to process messages.

```python
import pika

def consume_mq(queue: str, host: str = 'localhost', user: str = 'user', password: str = 'password'):
    def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
        print(f"Received message: {body}")

    credentials = pika.PlainCredentials(user, password)
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=host, credentials=credentials))
    channel = connection.channel()

    # Declare queue
    channel.queue_declare(queue=queue, durable=True)

    # Consume messages
    channel.basic_consume(queue=queue, on_message_callback=callback, auto_ack=True)
    print('Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C')
    channel.start_consuming()
```

### **Blocking Channel vs. Normal Channel**

- **Blocking Channel**: 
  - Blocks the execution until the operation is complete. 
  - Suitable for simpler, synchronous tasks.
  - Example: `channel.start_consuming()` will block until stopped.

- **Non-Blocking (Normal) Channel**:
  - Used in asynchronous environments where operations can run concurrently.
  - Suitable for more complex scenarios requiring multiple threads or asynchronous handling.

## Summary

- **Channel**: A virtual connection within a RabbitMQ connection used for all operations.
- **Exchange**: Routes messages to queues based on routing keys or other criteria.
- **Queue**: Stores messages until consumed.
- **Routing Key**: A string used to route messages to queues.

By using the provided functions, you can publish and consume messages with minimal setup. For continuous operation, you might want to keep the connection open, rather than connecting and disconnecting for each message. This approach is more efficient for real-time systems.
